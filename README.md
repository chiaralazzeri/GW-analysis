Neural Networks have become a viable alternative to match filtering for gravitational waves detection,  as  they can achieve the  same level of sensitivity  but  are more computationally efficient  [1]. The  scope  of  this  project  was to  develop  a  recurrent  neural  network  for  the detection of BBH merger signals. Unlike traditional feed-forward neural networks, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) does not analyse all the data at once, but in sections.  Also, due to its internal memory, each of its  outputs  depends  on  all  prior  inputs  [2]. The  network  developed  for  gravitation  wavedetection was modeled on a network designed for image classification. It was trained with 90K  template  waveforms  of  SNR 8,  each  1s  long,  consisting of either a signal  from  binary black holes merger  with  Gaussian  noise  or  only  Gaussian  noise:  it  was  then  tested  on  20k  template waveforms. As the network analyses a section of data at a time, a changing probability ofdetection can be obtained as the waveform goes through the network.  This can allow thesignal to be detected before the merger. Once the RNN gave satisfying results with single waveforms, reaching 90% accuracy, it was applied to the analysis of longer sequences of data, containing both noise and a signal with noise.  This required a more complex network, which was implemented by stacking 4 Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells,  which are RNN cells with an additional long-term component which allows the analysis of longer strings of data.In conclusion, the project showed that recurrent neural networks are a viable option forgravitational  waves  detection  and  that  their  structure  allows  for  the  detection  of  signals before merger.
